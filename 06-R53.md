# Route53

* Managed DNS
* Domain Registrar
* highly available
* scalable
* Authoritative DNS
  * authoritative == the customer can update DNS records

* Collection of rules and records which helps clients understand how to reach a server through urls
* In AWS the most commmon records are:
  * A: URL to IPv4
  * AAAA: URL to IPv6
  * CNAME: URL to URL
    * *can't* create a CNAME record for the top node of a DNS namespace (Zone Apex)
  * ALIAS: url to AWS resource
* Route53 can use:
  * public domain names you own/buy (myapp.mydomain.com)
  * private domain names that can be resolved by instances in your VPC (application1.company.internal)
* You pay $0.50 per hosted zone a month
  * Public Hosted Zone == contains records that specify how to route traffic on the internet (public domain names)
  * Private Hosted Zone == contains records that specify how to route traffic  within one or more VPCs (private domain names)

## Route53 TTL (Time To Live)

* Way for a client and browser to cache the response of the DNS - so as to not overload DNS
* High TTL (24hs)
  * less traffic on DNS
  * Possibly outdated records
* Low TTL (60secs)
  * more traffic on DNS
  * record are outdated for less time
  * easy to change records
* TTL is mandatory for each record *EXCEPT* for alias records

## CNAME vs ALIAS

* CNAME:
  * NAME points a URL to any other URL (app.mydomain.com => blabla.anything.com)
  * *ONLY for non root domain* (something.mydomain.com)
* ALIAS:
  * Points a URL to an AWS resource (app.mydomain.com => blabla.amaazonaws.com)
  * *Works for BOTH root domain and non root domain*
  * free of charge
  * native health check
  * automatically recognizes changes in the resources' IP address
  * always of type A/AAAA
  * TTL set automatically by R53
  * usual targets:
    * LB
    * CloudFront distributions
    * API Gateway
    * ElasticBeanstalk
    * S3 Websites
    * VPC Interface Endpoints
    * Global Accelerator
    * R53 record in the same hosted zone
  * *can't* an ALIAS record for an EC2 DNS Name

## Routing Policy

* Define how R53 responds to DNS queries

* Simple routing policy
  * maps domain to one URL
  * use when you need to redirect to a single resource
  * *can't* attach health checks to simple routing policy
  * if multiple values are returned => random one chosen by client
  * possible by adding more IPs on the *value box* on Route53
  * when *ALIAS* is enabled, specify only one AWS resource
* Weighted routing policy
  * control the percentage of requests that go to a specific endpoint
  * 70% to instance A, 20% to instance B, 10% to instance C
  * records must have the same name and type
  * can be associated with health checks
  * use cases:
    * helpful to test 1% of traffic on new app version
    * helpful to split traffic between regions
  * weigthed can have the same record entry more than once => when adding the record click on *routing policy* => WEIGHTED => Weight
  * 0 on 1 record == no traffic to resource
  * 0 on all records == all records will be returned equally
* Latency routing policy
  * redirects to server that has the least latency close to us
  * super helpful when latency of users is a priority
  * latency is evaluated in terms of user to designated AWS region
  * can have health checks
    * Germany may be redirected to US if that's the least latency
  * latency can have the same record entry more than once => when adding the record click on *routing policy* => LATENCY => REGION
* Failover
  * mandatory to associate primary record with a health check
  * when health checks fail, traffic routed to disaster recovery instance
  * can only have one *primary* and one *secondary*
  * primary record has to be associated with a HealthCheck
    * failover can have the same record entry more than once => when adding the record click on *routing policy* => FAILOVER => Failover Record Type => Primary or Secondary
* Geolocation
  * routing based on user location
  * we specify source traffic to go to specific IP
  * should create *default policy* in case there's no match on location
  * geolocation can have the same record entry more than once => when adding the record click on *routing policy* => GEOLOCATION => LOCATION (can be either continen, country or default)
* Geoproximity
  * routes traffic to your resources based on geo location of users and resources
  * ability to shift more traffic to resources based on a defined bias
    * to change the size of the geographic region = specify *bias* values:
      * to expand: 1 to 99 - more traffic to resource
      * to shrink: -1 to -99 - less traffic to resource
    * resources can be:
      * AWS resources (specify region)
      * Non-AWS resources (specify latitude and longitude)
    * you *must* use R53 Traffic Flow to use this feature
* Multi-Value
  * use when routing traffic to multiple resources
  * want to associate a Route53 health checks with records
  * up to 8 healthy records are returned for each multi value query
  * *NOT* a substitue for ELB
    * multi-value can have the same record entry more than once => when adding the record click on *routing policy* => MULTI-VALUE => SET ID => Associate with HealthCheck

## Health Checks

* HTTP Health Checks are only for *public resources*
* Route53 will not route traffic to instance if unhealthy
* health check => Automated DNS failover
  * health checks that monitor an endpoint (app, server, other AWS resource)
  * health checks that monitor other health checks (calculated health checks)
  * health checks that monitor CloudWatch Alarms (full control) => throttles of DynamoDB / alarms on RDS / custom metrics
* after X health checks passed => healthy (default 3)
* have X health checks failed => unhealthy (default 3)
* default health check interval: 30s (can set to 10s - higher cost)
* about 15 health checkers will check the endpoint health => one request every 2 secs on avg
* can have
  * HTTP
  * TCP
  * HTTPS (no SSL verification)
* can integrate with CloudWatch
* health checks pass only when the endpoint responds with 2xx and 3xx status
* health checks can be setup to pass / fail based on text in the *first 5120 bytes* of the response
* health checks can be integrated to Route53 DNS queries

* calculated health checks
  * combine the results of multiple health checks into a single check
  * you can user *OR*, *AND* or *NOT*
  * can monitor up to 256 child health checks
  * specify how many of the health checks need to pass to make the parent pass
  * use case:
    * perform maintenance to you app without causing all health checks to fail

⚠️ Private Hosted Zones Health Check How-To

* Create a CloudWatch metric and associate a CloudWatch alarm then create a health check that checks the alarm itself

### 3rd Party domains and Route53

* Route53 as a registrar
  * a domain names registrar is an organization that manages  the reservation of internet domain names
* Domain registrar != a DNS (but each registar usually comes with DNS service)
* If you buy your domain on 3rd party registrar you can still use Route53
  * create a hosted zone in Route53
  * update NS records on 3rd party website to use Route53 nameservers
