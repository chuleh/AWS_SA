# Route53
* Managed DNS
* Collection of rules and records which helps clients understand how to reach a server through urls
* In AWS the most commmon records are:
  - A: URL to IPv4
  - AAAA: URL to IPv6
  - CNAME: URl to URL
  - ALIAS: url to AWS resource
* Route53 can use:
  - public domain names you own/buy (myapp.mydomain.com)
  - private domain names that can be resolved by instances in your VPC (application1.company.internal)
* You pay $0.50 per hosted zone a month

## Route53 TTL (Time To Live)
* Way for a client and browser to cache the response of the DNS - so as to not overload DNS
* High TTL (24hs)
  - less traffic on DNS
  - Possibly outdated records
* Low TTL (60secs)
  - more traffic on DNS
  - record are outdated for less time
  - easy to change records
* TTL is mandatory for each record

## CNAME vs ALIAS
* CNAME:
  - NAME points a URL to any other URL (app.mydomain.com => blabla.anything.com)
  - _ONLY for non root domain_ (something.mydomain.com)
* ALIAS: 
  - Points a URL to an AWS resource (app.mydomain.com => blabla.amaazonaws.com)
  - _Works for BOTH root domain and non root domain_
  - free of charge
  - native health check

## Routing Policy
* Simple routing policy
  - maps domain to one URL
  - use when you need to redirect to a single resource
  - can't attach health checks to simple routing policy
  - if multiple values are returned => random one chosen by client
  - possible by adding more IPs on the _value box_ on Route53
* Weighted routing policy
  - control the percentage of requests that go to a specific endpoint
  - 70% to instance A, 20% to instance B, 10% to instance C
  - helpful to test 1% of traffic on new app version
  - helpful to split traffic between regions
  - can be associated with health checks
  - weigthed can have the same record entry more than once => when adding the record click on _routing policy_ =>
    WEIGHTED => Weight
* Latency routing policy
  - redirects to server that has the least latency close to us
  - super helpful when latency of users is a priority
  - latency is evaluated in terms of user to designated AWS region
    - Germany may be redirected to US if that's the least latency
  - latency can have the same record entry more than once => when adding the record click on _routing policy_ =>
    LATENCY => REGION

## Health Checks
* like ALB
* Route53 will not route traffic to instance if unhealthy
* after X health checks passed => healthy (default 3)
* have X health checks failed => unhealthy (default 3)
* default health check interval: 30s (can set to 10s - higher cost)
* about 15 health checkers will check the endpoint health => one request every 2 secs on avg
* can have
  - HTTP
  - TCP
  - HTTPS (no SSL verification)
* can integrate with CloudWatch
* health checks can be integrated to Route53 DNS queries

## Failover
* when health checks fail, traffic routed to disaster recovery instance
* can only have one _primary_ and one _secondary_
* primary record has to be associated with a HealthCheck
  - failover can have the same record entry more than once => when adding the record click on _routing policy_ =>
    FAILOVER => Failover Record Type => Primary or Secondary

## Geolocation
* routing based on user location
* we specify source traffic to go to specific IP
* should create _default policy_ in case there's no match on location
  - geolocation can have the same record entry more than once => when adding the record click on _routing policy_ =>
    GEOLOCATION => LOCATION (can be either continen, country or default)

## Multi-Value
* use when routing traffic to multiple resources
* want to associate a Route53 health checks with records
* up to 8 healthy records are returned for each multi value query
* not a substitue for ELB
  - multi-value can have the same record entry more than once => when adding the record click on _routing policy_ =>
    MULTI-VALUE => SET ID => Associate with HealthCheck 

## 3rd Party domains and Route53
* Route53 as a registrar
  - a domain names registrar is an organization that manages  the reservation of internet domain names
* Domain registrar != a DNS (but each registar usually comes with DNS service)
* If you buy your domain on 3rd party registrar you can still use Route53
  - create a hosted zone in Route53
  -  update NS records on 3rd party website to use Route53 nameservers
