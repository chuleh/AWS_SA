# ECS - Elastic Container Service

* Launch docker containers on AWS == launch *ECS tasks* on *ECS clusters*
* EC2 launch type:
  * must provision and maintain the infrastructure (EC2 instances)
  * each EC2 instance must run the *ECS agent* to register in the *ECS cluster*
  * AWS takes care of starting/stopping containers
* Fargate launch type:
  * launch docker containers on AWS
  * no infra provisioned (no EC2 instances) == serverless
  * just create task defitions
  * AWS just runs ECS tasks definition for you based on the CPU/RAM you need
  * to scale just increase the number of tasks

## IAM roles for ECS

* EC2 instance profile (EC2 Launch type *only*)
  * used by the ECS agent
  * make API calls to ECS service
  * send container logs to CloudWatch Logs
  * pull docker image from ECR
  * reference sensitive data in SecretsManager or SSM Parameter store
* ECS task role
  * valid for both launc types
  * allow each task to have a specific role
  * use diff roles for the different ECS services you run
  * task role defined in *task definition*

## Load Balancer integrations

* ALB supported and works for most cases
* NLB recommended only fir hi thruput
