# IPv6 for VPC

* succesor of IPv4
* designed to provide 3.4 * 10**38 unique IP addresses
* every ipv6 is public and internet routabl (no private range)
* format is hexadecimal
* can enable IPv6 in VPC to enable dual stack mode (ipv4 cannot be disabled for your vpc and subnets)
* your EC2 instances will get at least a private ipv4 ip and a public ipv6 ip
* can communicate either via v4 or v6 to the internet via an IGW

## IPv6 troubleshooting

* scenario: cannot launch an EC2 instance your subnet
  * it's not because it cannot acquire an IPv6 (space is large)
  * it' because you ran out IPv4 in your subnet
  * solution: create new CIDR in ipv4 subnet
