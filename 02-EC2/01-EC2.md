# EC2

## EC2 Basics

- Most popular service of AWS
- EC2 == Elastic Cloud Compute == Infrastructure as a Service
- It mainly consists on the capability of:
  - Renting virtual machines (EC2)
  - Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
  - Distributing load across machines (ELB)
  - Scale services using auto-scaling group (ASG)

## EC2 Sizing && Config

- Operating System: Linux, Windows, macOS
- CPU
- RAM
- Storage:
  - Network attached: EBS / EFS
  - Hardware: EC2 instance store
- Network Card: speed of the NIC / Public IP
- Firewall rules: Security groups
- Bootstrap Script: EC2 user data (configure at first launch)
  - *bootstrapping*: launching commands when instance starts
  - *runs only once* at the instance first start
  - EC2 User Data automate boot tasks suchs as:
    - installing updates
    - installing software
    - downloading files from the web
  - The more you add to User Data -> more time to boot
  - Runs with *root*

## EC2 Instance Basic Types

- AWS has the following convention:
  - eg: m5.2xlarge
    - m == instance class | 5 == generation (improves over time) | 2xlarge == size within the instance class

- General Purpose
  - `T` class
  - great for diversity of workloads: web servers / code repos
  - balance between:
    - compute
    - memory
    - networking
- Compute optimized
  - `C` class
  - great for compute intensive tasks == high performance processors
    - batch media workloads
    - media transcoding
    - high performance web servers
    - HPC == high performance computing
    - Scientific modeling && machine learning
    - Dedicated gaming servers
- Memory optimized
  - `R` class
  - `X1` class
  - `High Memory` class
  - `z` class
  - fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory
    - high performance relational/non-relational DBs
    - distributed web scale cache stores
    - in-memory databases optimized for BI
    - apps performing real-time processing of big unstructured data
- Storage optimized:
  - `I` class
  - `D` class
  - `H` class
  - great for storage intensive tasks that require high, sequential RW access to large data sets on local storage
    - OLTP system - high frequency online transaction processing systems
    - relational && NoSQL DBs
    - cache for in-memory DBs (redis)
    - data warehousing apps
    - distributed file systems

## EC2 Securiy Groups

- Fundamental of network security in AWS
  - control how traffic goes in and out of our EC2 instances
    - regulates:
      - access to ports
      - authorised IPv4 && IPv6 ranges
      - control of *inbound* network (from other to EC2)
      - control of *outbound* network (from EC2 to other)
  - `SG` only contains *allow* rules
  - `SG` rules can reference by IP or by *another* security group
  - can be attached to multiple instances
  - 1 instance can have several security groups
  - locked down to a region/VPC combination
  - lives *outside* EC2 - if traffic is blocked EC2 won't see it
  - `ProTip:` keep an SSH SG only isolated
  - app not accessible from outside (timeout) == sg issue
  - app accessible *but* *connection refused* == app error
  - all inbound traffic is *blocked* by default
  - all outbound traffic is *authorized* by default

## Classic ports to know

- 22 == SSH (secure shell) - log into Linux instance
- 21 == FTP (file transfer protocol) - upload files into a share
- 22 == SFTP (secure file transfer protocol) - upload files using ssh
- 80 == HTTP - unsecured web access
- 443 == HTTPS - secure web access
- 3389 == RDP (remote desktop protocol) - log into windows instance

## EC2 Purchasing options

- on-demand intances
  - short workload, predictable pricing, pay by second
  - pay for what you use
  - highest cost
  - no upfront payment
  - no long-term commitment
  - recommended for short term and uninterrupted workloads where you can't predict how app will behave
- reserved
  - up to 72% discount
  - reserve a specific instance attribute  (instance type, region, tenancy os)
  - reservation period
    - 1 year (+discount) - 3 years (+++discount)
  - payment options
    - no upfront (+) - partial upfront (++) - all upfront (+++)
  - reserved instance scope
    - *regional* or *zonal* (reserve capacity in AZ)
  - reserved instance - long workloads (1/3 years)
  - recommended for steady-state usage apps
  - can buy and sell in the `Reserved Instance Marketplace`
  - special one: *convertible reserved instance*
    - can change: EC2 instance type / instance family / OS / scope / tenancy
    - up to 66% discount
- savings plan
  - commit to an amount of usage, long workloads ($10 / hour for 1/3 years)
  - discount based on long-term usage (up to 72%)
  - usage beyond EC2 savings plan billed at on-demand price
  - *locked to* specific instance family and AWS region (eg: m5 in us-east-1)
  - flexible across:
    - instance size (m5.xlarge to m5.2xlarge)
    - OS
    - tenancy (host, dedicated, default)
- spot instances
  - short workloads, cheap, can lose instances (less reliable)
  - up to 90% discount
  - can be lost at any time if your max price is less than the current spot price
  - most *cost-efficent* instances in AWS
  - useful for workloads resistent to failures
    - batch jobs
    - data analysis
    - image processing
    - any distributed workloads
    - workloads with flexible start/stop time
  - not suitable for critical jobs
- dedicated hosts
  - physical server with EC2 instance fully dedicated to your use
  - allows to address *compliance requirements* and use your *server-bound software licenses*
  - purchasing options:
    - on-demand
    - reserved
  - most expensive option in AWS
  - useful for BYOL (bring your own license) / strong regulatory or compliance needs
- dedicated instances
  - instances run on hardware that's dedicated to you
  - may share hardware with instances in same account
  - no control over instance placement (can move hardware after stop/start)
- capacity reservation
  - reserve *on-demand* instances capacity in a specific AZ for any duration
  - always have access to EC2 capacity when you need it
  - no time commitment (create/cancel any time) *no billing discounts*
  - combine with *Regional Reserved Instances* and *Savings Plan* to benefit from billing discounts
  - charged at *on-demand* rate whether you run instances or not
  - suitable for short-term uninterrupted workloads in a specific AZ

## EC2 spot instances && Spot Fleet

- up to 90% discount compared to on-demand
- define *max spot price* and get the instance while *current spot price < max*
  - the hourly spot price varies based on offer and capacity
  - if *current spot price > your max price* you can choose to *stop* or *terminate* your instance with a *2 minute grace period*
- spot block => not supported after 31/12/2022 - still *might* appear in the exam
  - *block* spot instance during a specified time frame (1-6 hours) without interruption
  - in weird situations the instance may be reclaimed
- used for batch jobs, data analysis, workloads resistent to failure
- not suitable for critical jobs
- cancelling a spot request *does not* terminate instance
  - first cancel spot request then terminate associated spot instances

### Spot Fleets

- set of spot instances + (optional) on-demand instances
- spot fleet will try to meet the *target capacity* with *price constraints*
  - define possible launch pools:
    - instance type
    - os
    - AZ
- spot fleet stops launching instances when: reaching capacity *or* max cost

#### Strategies to allocate Spot Instances

- *lowestPrice*: from the pool with the lowest price (cost optimization, short workloads)
- *diversified*: distributed across all pools (great for availability, long workloads)
- *capacityOptimized*: pool with the optimal capacity for the number of instances
